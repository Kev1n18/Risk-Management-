## **Introduction**
PowerPlus is committed to innovation, sustainability, and security. It serves over 20 million electricity and 1.3 million gas customers globally. The organization emphasizes data protection, operational continuity, and compliance with regulations such as GDPR and NERC CIP.

Key features of PowerPlus:
- Dual IT and OT (Operational Technology) domains.
- Approximately 1,500 production servers, 10,000 databases, and redundant data centers.
- Use of Oracle and SAP for middleware and database management.

---

## **Objectives**
- Establish and operate a SOC aligned with ISO/IEC 27005 standards.
- Monitor and mitigate risks proactively.
- Enhance compliance with international regulations.
- Protect critical assets and ensure operational continuity.

---

## **SOC Preparation**
The SOC is a critical component for PowerPlus to detect, respond, and mitigate security incidents. Key elements include:
- **Structure:** Led by the CISO, includes monitoring teams, CSIRT, and security analysts.
- **Technology:** Features SIEM platforms, intrusion detection, and vulnerability management tools.
- **Policies:** Aligned with ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27005.

## **Risk Assessment**
### Key Risks Identified:
1. **Ransomware Attacks:** High probability and catastrophic impact.
2. **OT System Failures:** Potential disruptions to energy distribution.
3. **Data Breaches:** Exposure of personal data for millions of customers.

### Methodology:
- Identify risks, assets, threats, and vulnerabilities.
- Evaluate risks based on probability and impact using a risk matrix.

---

## **Risk Treatment**
### Strategies:
- **Modification:** Use firewalls, network segmentation, and regular backups.
- **Transfer:** Cyber insurance for residual risks.
- **Avoidance:** Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- **Mitigation:** Regular software updates and employee training.

---

## **Lessons Learned**
### Incident Scenarios:
1. **Data Breach:** Compromise of 6 million customer records mitigated by MFA and SIEM monitoring.
2. **OT Attacks:** Strengthen IT-OT segmentation and supplier security compliance.
3. **Data Center Outages:** Ensure redundancy and failover mechanisms in cloud infrastructures.

---

## **Conclusion**
The project highlights the importance of structured cybersecurity management, leveraging international standards like ISO/IEC 27001 and 27005. By establishing a robust SOC and adhering to risk management best practices, PowerPlus enhances its resilience against emerging threats, ensuring operational continuity and stakeholder trust.
