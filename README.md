## **Organizational Context**
### **Mission and Vision**
- **Mission:** Deliver energy sustainably, innovatively, and securely while maintaining strong customer relationships.
- **Vision:** Expand into renewable energies, embrace digital transformation, and enhance operational efficiency.

### **Infrastructure**
- **IT and OT Domains:** Specialized needs for administrative (IT) and industrial control systems (OT).
- **Servers and Databases:**
  - 1,500 production servers, 10,000 databases.
  - Redundant data centers separated by 100 km for disaster resilience.
- **Applications:** 200 critical systems, 20 of which manage personal data for 6 million customers.

## **SOC Preparation**
The **Security Operations Center (SOC)** is central to PowerPlus's cybersecurity strategy.

### **SOC Objectives**
1. **Proactive Monitoring:** 24/7 surveillance of IT and OT systems.
2. **Incident Response:** Rapid containment and recovery.
3. **Compliance:** Ensure adherence to GDPR, NERC CIP, and ISO/IEC standards.
4. **Vulnerability Management:** Regular assessment and mitigation.

### **SOC Structure**
- **Leadership:** Headed by the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).
- **Teams:**
  - **Monitoring Analysts:** Oversee real-time security events.
  - **CSIRT:** Handle incident response and recovery.
  - **Forensic Specialists:** Conduct investigations and penetration tests.

### **Technological Infrastructure**
- **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management):** Centralized data analysis from over 100 network components.
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):** Real-time threat detection.
- **Vulnerability Management Tools:** Ensure timely patching and updates.

## **Risk Management**
### **Risk Assessment**
#### **Identified Risks**
1. **Ransomware Attacks:**
   - High probability.
   - Catastrophic impact on operations and data integrity.
2. **OT Failures:**
   - Potential energy distribution disruptions.
3. **Data Breaches:**
   - Compromise of personal data for 6 million customers.

#### **Assessment Methodology**
- **Risk Matrix:** Combines probability (rare to almost certain) with impact (insignificant to catastrophic).
- **Data Sources:** Incident history, vulnerability scans, and external threat intelligence.

### **Risk Treatment**
#### **Strategies**
1. **Modification (Mitigation):**
   - Firewalls, network segmentation, and automated backups.
2. **Transfer:**
   - Cyber insurance policies for residual risks.
3. **Avoidance:**
   - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for access control.
4. **Reduction:**
   - Regular security patches and employee training.

---

## **Lessons Learned**
### **Incident Scenarios**
1. **Data Breach:**
   - Mitigation with MFA and continuous SIEM monitoring.
2. **OT Attacks:**
   - Strengthened IT-OT segmentation and supplier compliance.
3. **Data Center Failures:**
   - Redundant failover systems and rigorous disaster recovery testing.

### **Key Takeaways**
- Robust monitoring systems and well-defined escalation protocols are critical.
- Regular audits and penetration testing help identify and mitigate emerging vulnerabilities.
